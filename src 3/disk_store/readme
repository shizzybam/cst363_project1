Overview of disk_store package
  not all variables and methods are listed in this overview. 

HeapDB - the database table  (named Table in earlier assignments)
   contains reference to the BlockFile used to read/write blocks to disk
            reference to the Schema for the table
            recSize -- length of each record
            recsPerBlock -- number of records per block
            blockMap -- file BitMap for free space  (Block 1 of file)
            
            recMap  -- temp BitMap for a data block read from file
            buffer -- temp byte buffer for a data block read from file
            
            
   
            indexes - an array of current indices.  
                       indexes[i] is the index on column number i or 
                       null if column i does not have index
   
   open()   opens an existing database file
            to create a new database, use the constructor  DBHeap(filename, schema)
   
   close()
   
   size()   scans the file and returns count of rows.  This method shows one way to 
            do a linear scan of all rows in the table.  However it does not have 
            access to the bitmaps or the actual blocks of the table.  For a more 
            low level way to do a linear scan of all rows in the table see the method
            toStringDiagnostic()
   
   insert(Record r) inserts a records.   
            insert returns true, false if file is full or record is duplicate key.
   
   delete(int key) finds and delete row with key value. 
             returns true,  false if key is not found.
   
   createOrderedIndex()  creates an index on the table for a particular column. Column must be int data type.
   createHashindex() 
   
   initializeIndex()  used by create index to read all rows from the table and create index entries.
   
   lookup()  find a row either by key value or by using column name and value. 
             lookup will either do a linear search or use an index if an index exists on the column.
             returns the Record if found, or null if not found.
             
   lookupInBlock() searches a block for all rows with a column value.  
             Returns a list of records found.
             
   recordLocation(int i)  returns the offset in the block to the start of the ith record. i=0,1,2...
   
   toStringDiagnostic( )  a method that prints out all rows. It is a good example of how to do a linear
            scan of all blocks in the file and find all rows in each block.
 

Schema - table definition 
   contains a list of column names and column data types: IntType or StringType
   The schema must have a primary key of int datatype.
   
   size()   returns number of columns
   
   getLen() returns the size in bytes of a row
   
   blank()  returns an empty Record with default values (row)
   
   getName(int i)              get the Name of column i
   getType(String columnName)  get the type of the column
   getType(int i)              get the type of column i 
   getKey()                    get the name of the key column
   getKeyIndex()               get column number of key column (0 based)
   getFieldIndex(String columnName)  given column name, get the column number
   
   

Record - row (named Tuple in earlier assignments)
   contains a list of column values which are instances of IntField or StringField
   
   size()  return number of columns
   
   getSchema() 
   
   get/set(i)  get or set value of column number i (0 based)
   
   getKey()    return primary key value
   
   serialize() convert row into binary bytes
   
   deserialize()  convert binary bytes into column values replacing current values of this Record
   
OrdIndex
	insert(key, blockNumber)  -- add index entry
	delete(key, blockNumber)  -- remove index entry
	lookup(key) -- search for key value and return list of block numbers.  The list is empty if the key is not found.
	                There should not be any duplicate integers in the list of block numbers.
	

HashIndex
	insert(key, blockNumber)  -- add index entry
	delete(key, blockNumber)  -- remove index entry
	lookup(key) -- search for key value and return list of block numbers.  The list is empty if the key is not found.
	                There should not be any duplicate integers in the list of block numbers.

Classes related to storing the database in a file

  Bitmap  an array of bytes that can be manipulated a bits to keep track of freespace 
  
  BlockBuffer  a block of binary data.
     buffer is the binary data in the form of a java.nio.ByteBuffer rather than byte[] for efficiency
     
  BlockedFile
     open(file_name) static method.   Opens an existing file and returns a BlockedFile object.
     close()
     getBuffer()  returns an empty BlockBuffer 
     read()  - read a block from file given the block number (first block in file is 0) and a BlockBuffer
     write()
     getLastBlockIndex() - return the index of the last block in the file.
     
File format - 4096 byte blocks.  See BlockFile.getLastBlockIndex() for last block in file.
   Block 0 - used to write schema information
   Block 1 - BitMap of size 4096 bytes,  or 32768 bits 
             bit i = 0, block i has room for a record
             bit i = 1, block i is full
   Block 2+ - data blocks containing BitMap and n records.  n = HeapDB.recsPerBlock 
       offset 
       0               BitMap of size HeapDB.recMapSize bytes 
                            containing 0 <= i < recsPerBlock
                               bit i = 0  record i is free space
                               bit i = 1  record i contains row data.  
                                          Each row is fixed length = recSize.
                               
       recMapSize            start of slot 0
       recMapSize+i*recSize  start of slot i  (0 <= i < recsPerBlock)
